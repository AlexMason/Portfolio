        <p>Technology has been my passion, ever since I touched a computer I knew instantly what my calling was. Whether
          it
          was playing my dads MS-DOS horse racing game or tinkering with the early version of the internet, I always
          found a
          home in front of a keyboard.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have garnered experience with multiple facets of technology including hardware, operating
          systems, programming languages, command line interfaces, IoT devices, and mobile smartphones. My first deep
          dive
          into the technical world happened when I was 13 years old and played an online game called RuneScape. I have
          always had the knack to solve a problem myself, and my issue with this game was I couldn't cheat because
          everything was on the server side. My solution? Create my own server and connect the RuneScape client to that.
          So
          that is what I did and that led me down the path of learning Java, MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. This thrust into
          the
          interworking of what drove technology led my younger self into even more challenging problems such as running
          dedicated servers, automatic deployment, SEO, and as always the drive to continue learning technologies.</p>
        <p>So that leads me to now, I am an uncompleted technological encyclopedia with entries to be filled and
          knowledge
          to be scribed and have the same vigorous passion towards technology as my 6 year old self did back in 1999.
          And of
          this I yearn for more.</p>
